# Coupon Generator - MERN Stack with Vite

## Introduction
The **Coupon Generator** is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack** with **Vite** for a modern, high-performance frontend. The core feature of this project is generating unique coupons for individual users, ensuring that each IP address gets only **one coupon**. The application includes **login, signup, and an admin panel**, where the admin has complete control over coupon management.

## Project Description
This application allows users to claim a **unique coupon** based on their IP address. If a user doesnâ€™t want to sign up, a **guest login** option is available. The system provides a smooth user experience with **interactive backgrounds** and **secure authentication mechanisms** like password hashing using **Salt**.

### Features:
- **Unique Coupon Generation**: Each user/IP gets a single coupon.
- **Admin Panel**: Manage (Add, Delete, Modify) coupons.
- **Secure Authentication**: Password hashing with Salt.
- **Form Validation**: Used **Yup** for login and signup validations.
- **Guest Login**: Users can claim a coupon without signing up.
- **Interactive UI**: Enhanced with animated backgrounds.
- **REST API Integration**: Uses GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods for CRUD operations.

## Admin Page
The **Admin Panel** is the control center for managing coupons. Admins can:
- **Create new coupons**
- **Delete existing coupons**
- **Update coupon statuses** (claimed/unclaimed)

#### **Admin Credentials:**
- **Email**: `admin@example.com`
- **Password**: `Admin@123`

_Note: Change these credentials after deployment for security._
